      <h5>The rules outlined below are binding and will be adhered to, unless an act of God creates a situation in which we must circumvent the procedures outlined below.

          <li>Draft date will be subject to a vote by the entire league, and the majority vote will decide which date is chosen. </li>

          <li>Draft order is decided on a yearly basis, as agreed upon by a majority vote of the competition committee.  </li>
          <li>Draft order is to be decided 2 weeks before the draft date is set.  </li>

          <li>Keepers can be kept 2 additional years <strong>AFTER</strong> the year they are drafted </li>
          <li>Ex: Team A drafts player B in the 3rd round in 2022. In 2023, they will be available to be kept for a 2nd round pick. In 2024 they will be available to be kept for a 1st round pick. In 2025, that player is now back in the eligible player pool to be drafted. </li>
          <li>Keepers for the upcoming year must be chosen BEFORE the draft order is decided. </li>
          <li>If your keeper gets hurt before the draft starts, you are able to swap them out for another keeper. </li>
